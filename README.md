| **0**     | **CAISO Queue Canonical Dataset**           | CAISO interconnection data is fragmented, inconsistent, and non-analysis-ready | Build a clean, reproducible, queryable historical interconnection database | Public interconnection queue spreadsheets from CAISO; withdrawn & COD records | Data ingestion, cleaning, normalization, schema design, versioning    | Descriptive statistics; data validation checks              | Clean project IDs; technology classification; status timelines; MW rollups  | GitHub repo with raw & processed data; SQL schema; cleaning notebooks; README | Data engineering; SQL; pandas; reproducibility; schema thinking           | Signals rigor and seriousness; foundation for all analytics            |
| **1**     | **Queue Attrition & Survival Analysis**     | Most queued projects never reach COD, but risk is poorly quantified            | Estimate probability of project survival over time                         | Canonical dataset from Project 0                                              | Feature engineering; time-to-event labeling; cohort segmentation      | Kaplan–Meier survival curves; Cox proportional hazards      | Survival probability by tech & vintage; median survival time; hazard ratios | Notebooks; survival plots; short technical memo explaining attrition dynamics | Applied statistics; survival analysis; interpretability                   | Helps developers, investors, and ISOs understand “real MW” vs paper MW |
| **2**     | **Time-to-Interconnection Forecasting**     | Projects that survive still face multi-year delays with little predictability  | Forecast probabilistic timelines to COD                                    | Project 0 + milestone timestamps                                              | Censoring handling; conditional modeling; cluster-based comparisons   | Accelerated Failure Time (AFT); conditional survival models | P10 / P50 / P90 COD timelines; delay risk curves                            | Forecast notebooks; timeline visualizations; example diligence scenario       | Risk modeling; uncertainty quantification; decision-useful outputs        | Critical for financing, offtake scheduling, and rate-base planning     |
| **3**     | **Network Upgrade & Cost Risk Modeling**    | Network upgrade exposure is the largest hidden interconnection risk            | Predict likelihood and magnitude of upgrade costs                          | CAISO cluster study outputs; assigned upgrade cost data                       | Cost attribution; binary & continuous target modeling                 | Logistic regression; cost regression; quantile analysis     | Upgrade probability; expected upgrade cost; tail-risk indicators            | Upgrade risk models; cost exposure plots; explanatory README                  | Financial modeling; regression; translating grid constraints into dollars | Directly valuable to lenders, insurers, and infra funds                |
| **4**     | **Developer Quality & Behavioral Risk**     | Developer behavior strongly affects queue outcomes but is rarely quantified    | Measure developer-specific interconnection performance                     | Project-developer history from canonical dataset                              | Entity resolution; historical performance tracking; Bayesian updating | Empirical Bayes; hierarchical modeling                      | Developer credibility score; learning curves; withdrawal patterns           | Developer scoring notebook; methodology write-up                              | Advanced statistics; entity analytics; market structure insight           | Enables counterparty risk assessment and diligence                     |
| **5**     | **Interconnection Risk Score (MVP Engine)** | Decision-makers lack a unified, defensible interconnection risk metric         | Synthesize all models into a single project-level risk score               | Outputs from Projects 1–4                                                     | Feature synthesis; weighting logic; scenario testing                  | Composite scoring; probabilistic risk aggregation           | 0–100 Interconnection Risk Score; scenario sensitivity                      | End-to-end notebook or Python package; mock IC memo; product README           | Product thinking; system integration; communication                       | Looks like a real $50k-ACV diligence tool                              |
